# Staia Website

Official website for Staia, the astrology mobile app.

This website hosts the Privacy Policy and Terms of Service required for App Store submission.

## Contents

- `src/pages/` - Authored page content
- `src/_includes/` - Shared Eleventy layouts and partials
- `public/` - Static assets copied to the deployed site root
- `dist/` - Generated site output, ignored by git
- `.github/workflows/pages.yml` - GitHub Pages build and deploy workflow

## Hosting Contract

This site is built for the custom domain root at `https://lunaapp.io/`.
Templates use root-relative URLs such as `/style.css`, `/privacy/`, and
`/contact/`, so the generated artifact is not intended to be served from a
GitHub Pages project subpath.

GitHub Pages must publish from the Actions workflow artifact, and
`public/CNAME` must remain present so the built artifact contains `dist/CNAME`.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Repository

```bash
cd staia-website
git remote -v
```

Expected repository: `https://github.com/markymark2001/staia-website`.

### 2. Enable GitHub Pages Actions

Use the repository Pages settings to select **GitHub Actions** as the publishing
source. The included workflow builds `dist/` and deploys that artifact.

1. Go to `https://github.com/markymark2001/staia-website`.
2. Click **Settings** (top navigation)
3. Click **Pages** (left sidebar)
4. Under "Build and deployment":
   - Source: **GitHub Actions**
5. Click **Save**
6. Confirm Pages uses the `lunaapp.io` custom domain.

### 3. Connect Custom Domain (lunaapp.io)

#### Step 1: Configure DNS Settings

Log into your domain registrar (where you purchased lunaapp.io) and add these DNS records:

**For Root Domain (lunaapp.io):**

| Type | Name | Value | TTL |
|------|------|-------|-----|
| A | @ | 185.199.108.153 | 3600 |
| A | @ | 185.199.109.153 | 3600 |
| A | @ | 185.199.110.153 | 3600 |
| A | @ | 185.199.111.153 | 3600 |
| CNAME | www | markymark2001.github.io | 3600 |

#### Step 2: Configure GitHub Pages Custom Domain

1. Go to your GitHub repository settings
2. Click **Pages** (left sidebar)
3. Under "Custom domain", enter: **lunaapp.io**
4. Click **Save**
5. Wait for DNS check to complete (may take a few minutes)
6. Once verified, check **Enforce HTTPS** (automatic via Let's Encrypt)

**Note:** DNS propagation can take 24-48 hours, but usually completes within 15-30 minutes.

#### Step 3: Verify Setup

After DNS propagation, your website will be accessible at:

- `https://lunaapp.io`
- `https://www.lunaapp.io`
- `https://lunaapp.io/privacy/`
- `https://lunaapp.io/terms/`

**Test your setup:**

```bash
# Check DNS records (should show GitHub IPs)
dig lunaapp.io A

# Check CNAME (should show the GitHub Pages host)
dig www.lunaapp.io CNAME

# Test HTTPS (should return 200 OK)
curl -I https://lunaapp.io
```

### 4. App Store Connect Configuration

Once your website is live, use these URLs in App Store Connect:

**App Information:**
- **Marketing URL:** `https://lunaapp.io`
- **Privacy Policy URL:** `https://lunaapp.io/privacy/`
- **Terms of Service URL:** `https://lunaapp.io/terms/` (if requested)

**Subscription Information:**
- Include privacy policy and terms URLs in subscription descriptions

## Updating Content

To update the website content:

```bash
# Make content edits in src/pages or shared shell edits in src/_includes
vim src/pages/privacy.html  # or use your preferred editor

# Build the generated site locally
npm run build

# Preview with Eleventy's dev server
npm run dev

# Commit changes
git add .
git commit -m "Update privacy policy"

# Push to GitHub
git push origin main

# GitHub Pages will automatically redeploy (1-2 minutes)
```

Do not edit `dist/` directly. It is generated output and is rebuilt by GitHub Actions.

## Troubleshooting

### DNS Not Working

**Problem:** Custom domain shows "Page not found" or "DNS_PROBE_FINISHED_NXDOMAIN"

**Solutions:**
1. Wait longer - DNS can take up to 48 hours to propagate
2. Check DNS records are correct: `dig lunaapp.io A`
3. Clear your DNS cache:
   - Mac: `sudo dscacheutil -flushcache; sudo killall -HUP mDNSResponder`
   - Windows: `ipconfig /flushdns`
4. Try accessing in incognito mode or different browser

### HTTPS Not Working

**Problem:** "Your connection is not private" or HTTPS checkbox is grayed out

**Solutions:**
1. Wait for DNS verification to complete (green checkmark in GitHub Pages settings)
2. Ensure DNS records are correct
3. Disable and re-enable custom domain in GitHub Pages settings
4. Wait 15-30 minutes for Let's Encrypt certificate to be issued

### 404 Error on Subpages

**Problem:** `lunaapp.io` works but `lunaapp.io/privacy/` shows 404

**Solutions:**
1. Ensure GitHub Pages is publishing from the Actions workflow artifact, not from the repository root
2. Run `npm run build` and confirm `dist/privacy/index.html` and `dist/terms/index.html` exist
3. Clear GitHub Pages cache by making a small commit and pushing

### Cloudflare Issues

**Problem:** Custom domain not working with Cloudflare

**Solutions:**
1. Set DNS records to "DNS only" (gray cloud), not "Proxied" (orange cloud)
2. Disable Cloudflare's "Always Use HTTPS" temporarily during setup
3. Add page rule to bypass cache: `lunaapp.io/*` → Cache Level: Bypass
